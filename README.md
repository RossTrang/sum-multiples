# sum-multiples
The Odin Project JavaScript checkpoint
  - Project Euller Exc. 1
    - Find sum of all numbers below 1000 divisible by two arbitary numbers, initally 3 & 5.
    
    multiples35.js was written after a 40 minute introduction to JS (It shows). It uses the IsInteger method.
    
    multiples35v2.js was written after spending time to go through the Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp JavaScript chapters. It uses the modulus operator.
    
    user-multiples.* were written to allow a user to input the two numbers.

    multiples35.rb was refactored from the JS v2 version.
